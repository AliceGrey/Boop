# Boop

Current release: **1.0.1**
(1.1.0 is almost here)

Boop is a C# implementation of the [servefiles.py from FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/tree/2.4.5/servefiles)

Boop is completely rewritten in C# and thus is snek friendly (No python needed).

Enough talk! Take me to the [download page!](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/Boop/releases/latest)

## Features:

* Easy to use GUI.
* Drag and Drop to the .exe support.
